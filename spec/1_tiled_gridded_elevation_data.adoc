== Tiled Gridded Elevation Data Extension (Normative)

=== Extension Title

Tiled Gridded Elevation Data

=== Introduction

The GeoPackage Standards Working Group (SWG) has identified a need for the ability to store tiled gridded elevation data in a GeoPackage. This capability will be used to support use cases such as the following:

*	Visualization
**	2D (hillshade, color relief, slope)
**	3D (supporting changing view angles and level of detail)
*	Analysis
**	Viewshed and line-of-sight
** Cross-country mobility (off-road routing)
** Site suitability and planning (slope analysis such as helicopter landing zones)
** 3D geometry representations of features (ground-based, airspace)
**	Terrain association (associating images to mapped locations)
**	Augmented reality training

:elevation_precision: footnote:[We acknowledge that this approach will not support certain applications that require a high degree of precision and/or accuracy (e.g., targeting).]
This extension to the OGC GeoPackage Encoding Standard leverages the existing structure for raster tiles using PNG files as the container for the elevation values themselves.
This capability was designed to be relatively easy to implement and to be suitable for a wide variety of computing environments including the mobile/handheld computing environment{elevation_precision}.

=== Extension Author

GeoPackage SWG, author_name `gpkg`.

=== Extension Name or Template

`gpkg_elevation_tiles`

=== Extension Type

New requirement dependent on http://www.geopackage.org/spec/#tiles[Clause 2.2].

=== Applicability

This extension applies to http://www.geopackage.org/spec/#tiles_user_tables[tile pyramid user data tables] that are used to hold tiled, gridded elevation data.

=== Scope

read-write

=== Requirements

==== Table Definitions
[[coverage_ancillary]]
===== Coverage Ancillary
[requirement] A GeoPackage that contains tiled gridded elevation data SHALL contain a `gpkg_2D_gridded_coverage_ancillary` table or view as per <<gpkg_2D_gridded_coverage_ancillary_table>>.
Subsequent extensions or custom implementations MAY add additional columns to this table.
Clients SHALL ignore additional columns that are unrecognized.

:real_value: footnote:[This is a REAL to support extensions that use non-integer data.]

==== Table Values
===== `gpkg_contents`
:vertical_datum: footnote:[Ideally the vertical datum for each pyramid of elevation will be specified. However, it is impractical to mandate this for a number of reasons, including the difficulty in testing whether a specific SRS has a valid vertical datum.]
[requirement] (extends http://www.geopackage.org/spec/#_requirement-34[GPKG-34]) The http://www.geopackage.org/spec/#_contents[`gpkg_contents`] table SHALL contain a row with a `data_type` column value of `2D-gridded-coverage` for each tile pyramid containing tiled gridded elevation data. The `srs_id` column value for that row SHOULD reference an SRS that has a vertical datum{vertical_datum}.

===== `gpkg_extensions`
[requirement] GeoPackages complying with this extension SHALL have rows in the `gpkg_extensions` table as described in <<gpkg_extensions_records>>:

:naming_authority: footnote:[Pending OGC naming authority decision.]
