== Tiled Gridded Elevation Data, TIFF Encoding Extension (Normative)

=== Extension Title

Tiled Gridded Elevation Data, TIFF Encoding

=== Introduction

The GeoPackage Standards Working Group (SWG) has identified a need to store 32-bit tiled gridded elevation data in a GeoPackage.
This extension builds off of the <<tiled_gridded_elevation_data>> extension and adds support for TIFF files to handle 32-bit (floating point) data.
The TIFF files are constrained as follows:

*	One sample per pixel
*	LZW compression may be used
*	No subfiles or internal tiles

=== Extension Author

GeoPackage SWG, author_name `gpkg`.

=== Extension Name or Template

`gpkg_elevation_tiles_tiff`

=== Extension Type

Extension of Existing Requirement in Clauses http://www.geopackage.org/spec/#tile_enc_png[2.2.4], http://www.geopackage.org/spec/#tile_enc_jpeg[2.2.5], and <<tiled_gridded_elevation_data>>.
New Requirement Dependent on <<3>>.

=== Applicability

`tile_data` columns in http://www.geopackage.org/spec/#tiles_user_tables[tile pyramid user data tables]

=== Scope

read-write

=== Requirements

==== MIME Type
[requirement] (extends http://www.geopackage.org/spec/#_requirement-35[GPKG-35],  http://www.geopackage.org/spec/#_requirement-36[GPKG-36])
A GeoPackage that contains a http://www.geopackage.org/spec/#tiles_user_tables[tile pyramid user data table] MAY store BLOBs in the `tile_data` column in MIME type `image/tiff`.
The content of the data table SHALL NOT be raster tiles as per the core specification and SHALL be described by an extension such as <<tiled_gridded_elevation_data>>.


==== Table Values
[[coverage_ancillary_tiff]]

===== Coverage Ancillary
[[gpkg_2D_gridded_coverage_ancillary_table_tiff]]
[requirement] (extends <<coverage_ancillary>> Req-1) For tile pyramids containing 32-bit gridded elevation data, the `gpkg_2D_gridded_coverage_ancillary` `datatype` SHALL be 'float'.

===== Tile Pyramid User Data Tables
[requirement] (extends http://www.geopackage.org/spec/#_requirement-36[GPKG-36], http://www.geopackage.org/spec/#_requirement-37[GPKG-37]) For tile pyramids containing 32-bit gridded elevation data, the `tile_data` BLOB in the tile pyramid user data table SHALL be of MIME type `image/tiff` as described in <<tiff_encoding>>.

===== `gpkg_extensions`
[requirement] GeoPackages complying with this extension SHALL have a row in the `gpkg_extensions` table for each  as described in <<gpkg_extensions_records>>:

==== TIFF Encoding
[[tiff_encoding]]
[requirement] (constrains TIFF<<3>> Section 2) A TIFF file storing tiled gridded elevation data SHALL have one sample per pixel.

[requirement] (constrains TIFF<<3>> Section 2) A TIFF file storing tiled gridded elevation data SHALL have the 32-bit floating (FLOAT – 11) data type.

[requirement] A TIFF file storing tiled gridded elevation data MAY use the LZW compression option as per TIFF<<3>> Section 13. Client applications SHALL support this option.

[requirement] (constrains TIFF<<3>> Section 2) A TIFF file storing tiled gridded elevation data SHALL NOT contain multiple images per TIFF file.

[requirement] (constrains TIFF<<3>> Section 15) A TIFF file storing tiled gridded elevation data SHALL NOT contain internal tiles as per TIFF Section 15.
